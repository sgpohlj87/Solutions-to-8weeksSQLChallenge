--Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi

-- A. Customer Journey

--Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
--Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-- B. Data Analysis Questions

--1.How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;

--11.How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

ORDER BY customer_id, plan_id) AS subquery
WHERE lead_date IS NOT NULL AND start_date >= lead_date;

--C. Challenge Payment Question

--The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
--monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
--upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
--upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
--once a customer churns they will no longer make payment

--Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
/*--
customer_id	plan_id	plan_name	payment_date	amount	payment_order
1	1	basic monthly	2020-08-08	9.90	1
1	1	basic monthly	2020-09-08	9.90	2

--D. Outside The Box Questions
--The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

--1.How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
--2.What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?

--4.If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
--5.What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
